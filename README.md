How to use the Workout Log

If you want to create a new Trainer, select add Trainer. The admin password is "fun2workout".

If you want to view existing accounts with pre-loaded workouts:

For the trainer: username is bcaruana password is swim
For the athletes: username is jbezos password is amazon (has run workouts)*
                  username is bgates password is windows (has swim workouts)*
                  username is sjobs password is apple (has yoga workouts)*
* I made a new user for each of the distinct workout types as their workout log and pace will look different *
* yoga will behave just like lift and run will behave the same as walk and bike *

Extra Notes:

I did exception handling for the following cases: if a user enters a non-number when a number is needed and
if a user enters an index number of an arraylist that does not exist.
